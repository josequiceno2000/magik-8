Themed Shakespearean Magic 8-Ball with voice activation and sentiment analysis

## Blueprint
- Uniquely styled responses from different Shakespearean characters
- Ability to choose the character responding

- Allow users to ask questions out loud using speech_recognition library
- Have the 8-Ball respond using pyttsx3

- Use sentiment analysis to decide how to answer
- Use textblob or nltk to detect positive, neutral, or negative tones
- If the question is negative, provide a motivational answer!

## Steps:
1. ~~Create a main.py set up properly~~ âœ“
2. Get user input using speech_recognition library.
